**Smart Words** is a simple web application written in Scala (backend) and HTML/CSS/JS (frontend) which focuses on different games with words.

Currently only a quiz type of game is available which supports two types of modes:
* guessing the definition of the specified word,
* guessing the word based on a provided definition.

User can extend the current capabilities by creating a new word dictionaries for different languages, as well as edit the currently exisiting ones. The modes mentioned above can be edited via the UI by adjusting their input parameters, options, and labels.
