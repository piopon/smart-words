Upon creation it provides a specified question number with four possible answers, receives and processes responsens and sends a response with correct or incorrect answer status. 
Finally after finishing a quiz it calculates the end result.

It's responsible for handling CRUD operations on dictionaries: adding new word to a specified dictionary JSON file, reading dictionary JSON files, editing and removing an existing word in a dictionary.
This service has built-in dictionary files which user can edit, read or delete, but any new file is saved in a separate JSON file to separate the built-in words from user created ones.<br>
