# smart-words / backend / service-word

Service for handling word and dictionary files for different games and/or modes.

It's responsible for handling CRUD operations on dictionaries: adding new word to a specified dictionary JSON file, reading dictionary JSON files, editing and removing an existing word in a dictionary.<br>
This service has built-in dictionary files which user can edit, read or delete, but any new file is saved in a separate JSON file to separate the built-in words from user created ones.
