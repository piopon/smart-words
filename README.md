**Smart Words** is a simple web application written in Scala (backend) and HTML/CSS/JS (frontend) which focuses on different games with words.

Currently only a quiz type of game is available which supports two types of modes:
* guessing the definition of the specified word,
* guessing the word based on a provided definition.

User can extend the current capabilities by creating a new word dictionaries for different languages, as well as edit the currently exisiting ones. The modes mentioned above can be edited via the UI by adjusting their input parameters, options, and labels.

## why?

This application started as a hobby side-project useful for learning and consolidating new words in different languages in the form of various fun games.
The first and most obvious choice was to create a quiz game where the user has four options to select the correct answer.
Currently this is the only type of game fully implemented but there is a plan to add more modes like: hangman or wordly-like game.

> **Warning**
> I don't have an exact plan for when new game modes will be added to the app.

Initially, this application was to be written entirely in HTML/CSS/JS and run entirely on the client side.
Over time, this concept has evolved and the logic has been applied to the microservices architecture.
Having that said now it all ended that:
* the frontend logic is done in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
* the backend logic is divided into services written in Scala:
  * quiz service - responsible for controlling quiz game type which includes: starting and stopping quizzes, receiving questions and sending answers, and calculating the final result
  * word service - responsible for handling different words and dicrionarires for specific languages. This includes: reading, adding, deleting, and updating words in appropriate dictionary files, and handle those files as well.

No database engine is currently used. All data is saved directly in the JSON files. New words are saved in a entirely new files which all are read while starting word service. Quiz service has only in-memory database for now (quizzes are stored in a map).

## running application

> **Note**
> I realize that the current way of launching the application is cumbersome (at least), so I'm going to improve it.
> This section of the documentation will be updated as it happens. Stay tuned.

Currently there is no release package or Docker image distribution.

One can manually invoke the [interactive `sbt` tool](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/index.html) (initially reffered to as `Simple Build Tool`, then redefined to `Scala Build Tool`, but really the name doesnâ€™t stand for anything, itâ€™s just `sbt` ðŸ˜Ž) to create JAR packages for both backend services and after that run them on the same machine, and then open the `index.html` page from the `frontend` directory.

Alternatively, one can use the IntelliJ editor and run both services in it, and then run `index.html` from the `frontend` folder.
